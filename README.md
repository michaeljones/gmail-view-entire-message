gmail-view-entire-message
=========================

A greasemonkey script to add a **View entire message** link at the top of gmail
messages that are clipped. This saves you scrolling to the bottom of the
message to click on the link there.

Broken
------

Unfortunately, this script no longer works as the Gmail Greasemonkey API has
stopped functioning and there appears to be no plans to update it.
