gmail-view-entire-message
=========================

A greasemonkey script to add a **View entire message** link at the top of gmail
messages that are clipped. This saves you scrolling to the bottom of the
message to click on the link there.

Installation
------------

Greasemonkey seems to get a little confused if you look at the standard github
view for the `gmail-view-entire-message.user.js` file, so it is best to look at
the [raw version](http://github.com/michaeljones/gmail-view-entire-message/raw/master/gmail-view-entire-message.user.js)
and Greasemonkey should pop up an install dialogue.

The script is also hosted on [userscripts.com](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/63051).

Requirements
------------

* Firefox
* Greasemonkey
